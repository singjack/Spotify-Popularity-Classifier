# Spotify-Popularity-Classifier
Collaborators: Nick Lee, Marc Jimenez

This is a Spotify classifier that uses machine learning in order to predict whether any given track on Spotify is considered popular or not based on various features of the songs.
In order to achieve this, we used data [from a database found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) consisting of data from over 160,000 songs.

Features including acousticness, loudness, energy, danceability, etc. were all used in the classification process of whether or not a song is considered popular or not.
