# Spotify-Popularity-Classifier
Collaborators: Nick Lee, Marc Jimenez

This is a Spotify classifier that uses machine learning in order to classify whether any given track on Spotify is considered popular or not based on various features of said track.
In order to achieve this, we used data [from a database found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) consisting of data from over 160,000 songs.
